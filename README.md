# EMI-Predict-AI
💰 EMIPredict AI AI-Powered EMI Eligibility & Credit Risk Assessment System

A production-ready FinTech Machine Learning application that predicts loan approval and affordable EMI using real-world financial data.

🚀 Project Overview

EMIPredict AI is an end-to-end Machine Learning system designed to simulate how banks, NBFCs, and FinTech companies assess customer loan eligibility and EMI affordability.

The project covers the complete ML lifecycle:

Data preprocessing

Feature engineering

Model training & evaluation

Model deployment using Streamlit

Robust error handling & production-safe UI

🎯 Business Problem

Financial institutions must quickly decide:

Is a customer eligible for a loan?

What is the maximum safe EMI they can afford?

Manual evaluation is slow and inconsistent. EMIPredict AI automates this decision using Machine Learning.

🧠 Solution Approach

This project uses two ML models:

1️⃣ Classification Model

Predicts:

Loan Approved (Yes / No)

2️⃣ Regression Model

Predicts:

Maximum Affordable EMI Amount

Both models are trained on processed financial data and deployed in a real-time Streamlit web application.
